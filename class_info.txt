Description
Content:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Students will explore fundamental concepts, algorithms, and techniques and gain practical experience implementing AI systems. The course will cover topics such as:
- Introduction to AI and ML: History, applications, and impact
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Linear regression, logistic regression, and classification algorithms
- Decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Reinforcement learning basics
- Natural language processing (NLP) techniques
- Computer vision and image recognition
- Ethical considerations in AI

Previous Knowledge Expected:
CS1001: Introduction to Computer Science
CS2002: Data Structures and Algorithms
MATH2003: Linear Algebra

Objective:
After completing this course, students will understand the core principles of artificial intelligence and machine learning, including the ability to design and implement basic AI and ML models. They will also be familiar with the ethical and societal implications of AI technologies.

Teaching and Learning Method
Classes will involve lectures and in-class exercises. Weekly homework assignments will reinforce the concepts learned in class. There will be a midterm exam and a final project focused on developing a machine learning model for a specific problem.

Course Criteria and Registration
All students are required to attend the first class for course registration.
